{"name":"STOKE","tagline":"A Stochastic Optimizer for x86_64","body":"STOKE\r\n=====\r\n\r\nSTOKE is a stochastic optimizer for the x86_64 instruction set. STOKE uses\r\nrandom search to explore the extremely high-dimensional space of all possible\r\nprogram transformations. Although any one random transformation is unlikely to\r\nproduce a code sequence that is both correct and an improvement over the\r\noriginal, the repeated application of millions of transformations is sufficient\r\nto produce novel and non-obvious code sequences that have been shown to\r\noutperform the code produced by general-purpose and domain-specific compilers,\r\n           and in some cases expert hand-written code.\r\n\r\nSTOKE has appeared in a number of publications.

STOKE should also run on Sandy Bridge\r\nsystems (with AVX, but not AVX2), and Nehalem systems without either extension;\r\nhowever officially these targets are not supported.  \r\n\r\nTo check what level of hardware support you have, run:\r\n\r\n    $ less /proc/cpuinfo\r\n    \r\nand check if the following cpu flags are present:\r\n\r\n    $ flags: ... avx avx2 bmi bmi2 popcnt ...\r\n\r\nIf you don't have 'avx' or 'avx2', you will need to compile for nehalem.  If\r\nyou have 'avx', but not avx2, you will compile for 'sandybridge'.  If you have\r\nboth, you can use the default make targets.  Build instructions are in the next\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nSTOKE is supported on the latest Ubuntu LTS release; in practice, it will also\r\nrun on Ubuntu 13.10+ and on debian testing.  If you're trying to get STOKE to\r\nwork on another linux distribution, having the right version of g++ is key.\r\nSTOKE is supported on 4.8.2 only (this is the current version in Ubuntu 14.04).\r\nIt should also work on 4.9.1, but in the past this has required minor tweaks\r\n(4.9.1 is the current version in Debian testing).  g++ 4.7.x and older\r\ndefinitely will not work.\r\n\r\nMost of STOKE's software dependencies are available through apt. These can be\r\nsatisfied by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install git subversion flex bison ccache doxygen g++ g++-multilib ghc libghc-regex-tdfa-dev libghc-regex-compat-dev libghc-split-dev cmake libghc-regex-compat-dev libjsoncpp-dev\r\n\r\nThe rest of the dependencies will be fetched automatically as part of the build\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nDownloading and Building STOKE\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe entire STOKE code base, is available on github under the Apache Software\r\nLicense version 2.0. To clone a copy of the source code, type:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/eschkufz/stoke\r\n\r\nThe remainder of STOKE's software dependencies are available on github and will\r\nbe downloaded automatically the first time that STOKE is built. To build stoke for a Haswell system\r\ntype the appropriate command for your system (the default is Haswell):\r\n\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make sandybridge\r\n    $ make nehalem\r\n\r\nTo add STOKE and its related components to your path, type:\r\n\r\n    $ export PATH=$PATH:/<path_to_stoke>/bin\r\n\r\nSetting the path is important for the testing tools to run.  To run the tests,\r\nchoose the appropriate command:\r\n\r\n    $ make test\r\n    $ make sandybridge_test\r\n    $ make nehalem_test\r\n\r\nThe files generated during the build process can be deleted by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ make clean\r\n    \r\nTo delete STOKE's github-hosted software dependencies as well (this is useful if an error occurs during the first build), type:\r\n\r\n    $ make dist_clean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing STOKE\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe following toy example shows a typical workflow for using STOKE. All of the\r\nfollowing code can be found in the `examples/tutorial/` directory. Consider a\r\nC++ program that repeatedly counts the number of bits (population count) in the\r\n64-bit representation of an integer. (Keeping track of a running sum prevents\r\n`g++` from eliminating the calls to `popcnt()` altogether.)\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// main.cc\r\n\r\n#include <cstdlib>\r\n#include <stddef.h>\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nsize_t popcnt(uint64_t x) {\r\n  int res = 0;\r\n  for ( ; x > 0; x >>= 1 ) {\r\n    res += x & 0x1ull;\r\n  }\r\n  return res;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n  const auto itr = atoi(argv[1]);\r\n\r\n  auto ret = 0;\r\n  for ( auto i = 0; i < itr; ++i ) {\r\n    ret += popcnt(i);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return ret;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSTOKE is a compiler and programming language agnostic optimization tool. It can\r\nbe applied to any x86_64 ELF binary. Although this example uses the GNU\r\ntoolchain, nothing prevents the use of other tools. To build this code with\r\nfull optimizations, type:\r\n\r\n    $ g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -fno-inline main.cc\r\n    \r\nTo measure runtime, type:\r\n\r\n    $ time ./a.out 100000000\r\n    \r\n    real  0m1.046s\r\n    user  0m1.047s\r\n    sys\t  0m0.000s\r\n    \r\nA profiler will reveal that the runtime of `./a.out` is dominated by calls to\r\nthe `popcnt()` function. STOKE can be used to improve the implementation of\r\nthis function as follows. The first step is to disassemble the program by\r\ntyping:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke extract -i ./a.out -o bins\r\n    \r\nThis will produce a directory named `bins` that contains the text of every\r\nfunction contained in the binary `./a.out`. \r\n\r\nHelp for stoke or any of its subcommands can be obtained by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke -h\r\n    $ stoke <subcommand> -h\r\n    \r\nSTOKE can accept arguments either through the command line or through a\r\nconfiguration file. The invocation of `stoke extract` shown above is equivalent\r\nto the following:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke extract --config extract.conf\r\n    \r\nWhere `extract.conf` contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n##### stoke extract config file\r\n\r\n-i ./a.out # Path to the elf binary to disassemble\r\n-o bins # Path to the directory to store disassembled text in\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery STOKE subcommand can be used to generate example configuration files by\r\ntyping:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke <subcommand> --example_config <path/to/file.conf>\r\n\r\nBecause `main.cc` was compiled using `g++`, the text of the `popcnt()` function\r\nwill appear under the mangled name `_Z6popcntm` in `bins/_Z6popcntm.s`.\r\n\r\n```asm\r\n  .text\r\n  .globl _Z6popcntm\r\n  .type _Z6popcntm, @function\r\n_Z6popcntm:\r\n  xorl   %eax,%eax\r\n  testq  %rdi,%rdi\r\n  je     .L_4005b0\r\n  nop\r\n.L_4005a0:\r\n  movq   %rdi,%rdx\r\n  andl   $0x1,%edx\r\n  addq   %rdx,%rax\r\n  shrq   $0x1,%rdi\r\n  jne    .L_4005a0\r\n  retq\r\n.L_4005b0:\r\n  retq\r\n  nop\r\n  nop\r\n  .size _Z6popcntm, .-_Z6popcntm\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next step is to generate a set of testcases for guiding STOKE's search\r\nprocedure. These can be obtained by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke testcase --config testcase.conf\r\n    \r\nwhere `testcase.conf` contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n##### stoke testcase config file\r\n\r\n--bin ./a.out # The name of the binary to use to generate testcases \r\n--args 10000000 # Command line arguments that should be passed to ./a.out\r\n\r\n-o popcnt.tc # Path to file to write testcases to\r\n\r\n--fxn _Z6popcntm # The name of the function to generate testcases for\r\n--max_testcases 1024 # The maximum number of testcases to generate. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting file will contain 1024 entires, all of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTestcase 0:\r\n\r\n%rax     00 00 00 00 00 98 96 80\r\n%rcx     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%rdx     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0a\r\n%rbx     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01\r\n%rsp     00 00 7f ff 97 44 36 28\r\n%rbp     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%rsi     19 99 99 99 99 99 99 99\r\n%rdi     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%r8      00 00 2a c9 68 1a 50 40\r\n%r9      00 00 7f ff 97 44 46 01\r\n%r10     00 00 00 00 00 98 96 80\r\n%r11     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0a\r\n%r12     00 00 00 00 00 98 96 80\r\n%r13     00 00 7f ff 97 44 37 20\r\n%r14     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%r15     00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n\r\n%ymm0    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff 00 00\r\n%ymm1    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f 2f\r\n%ymm2    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm3    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff\r\n%ymm4    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm5    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm6    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm7    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm8    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm9    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm10   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm11   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm12   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm13   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm14   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n%ymm15   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n\r\n%cf      0 \r\n%1       1 \r\n%pf      1 \r\n%0       0 \r\n%af      0 \r\n%0       0 \r\n%zf      0 \r\n%sf      0 \r\n%tf      0 \r\n%if      1 \r\n%df      0 \r\n%of      0 \r\n%iopl[0] 0 \r\n%iopl[1] 0 \r\n%nt      0 \r\n%0       0 \r\n%rf      0 \r\n%vm      0 \r\n%ac      0 \r\n%vif     0 \r\n%vip     0 \r\n%id      0 \r\n\r\n[ 00007fff 97443630 - 00007fff 97443620 ]\r\n[ 1 valid rows shown ]\r\n\r\n00007fff 97443628   d d d d d d d d   00 00 00 00 00 40 04 6c\r\n\r\n[ 00000000 00000000 - 00000000 00000000 ]\r\n[ 0 valid rows shown ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach entry corresponds to the hardware state that was observed just prior to an\r\nexecution of the `popcnt()` function. The first 60 rows represent the contents\r\nof general purpose, sse, and eflags registers, and the remaining rows represent \r\nthe contents of memory, both on the stack and the heap. Memory is shown eight bytes\r\nat a time, where a block of eight bytes appears only if the target dereferenced\r\nat least one of those bytes. Each row contains values and state flags. Bytes\r\nare flagged as either (v)alid (the target dereferenced this byte), (d)efined\r\n(the target read this byte prior to reading its value), or (.)invalid (the\r\n    target did not dereference this byte). \r\n\r\nEach of the random transformations performed by STOKE are evaluated with\r\nrespect to the contents of this file. Rewrites are compiled into a sandbox and\r\nexecuted beginning from the machine state represented by each entry. Rewrites\r\nare only permitted to dereference defined locations. This includes registers\r\nthat are flagged as `def_in` (see `search.conf`, below), memory locations that\r\nare flagged as 'd', or locations that were written previously. Rewrites are\r\npermitted to write values to all registers and to any memory location that is\r\nflagged as valid. \r\n\r\nThe STOKE sandbox will safely halt the execution of rewrites that perform\r\nundefined behavior. This includes leaving registers in a state that violates\r\nthe x86_64 callee-save ABI, dereferencing invalid memory, performing a\r\ncomputation that results in a floating-point exception, or becoming trapped in\r\na loop that performs more than `max_jumps` (see `search.conf`, below). \r\n\r\nThe final step is to use these testcases and the target code contained in\r\n`bins/_Z6popcntm.s` to run STOKE search by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke search --config search.conf\r\n    \r\nwhere `search.conf` contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n##### stoke search config file\r\n\r\n--out result.s # Path to write results to\r\n\r\n--target bins/_Z6popcntm.s # Path to the function to optimize\r\n--init empty # Begin search from all nops \r\n\r\n--def_in \"{ %rax %rdi }\" # The registers that are defined on entry to the target\r\n--live_out \"{ %rax }\" # The registers that are live on exit from the target\r\n\r\n--testcases popcnt.tc # Path to testcase file\r\n--training_set \"{ 0 ... 7 }\" # Testcases to use for measuring correctness during search\r\n--test_set \"{ 8 ... 1023 }\"  # Testcases to use as holdout set for checking correctness\r\n\r\n--distance hamming # Metric for measuring error between live-outs\r\n--relax_reg # Allow partial credit for results that appear in wrong locations\r\n--misalign_penalty 1 # Penalty for results that appear in the wrong location\r\n--reduction sum # Method for summing errors across testcases\r\n--sig_penalty 9999 # Score to assign to rewrites that produce non-zero signals\r\n\r\n--perf latency # Measure performance by summing instruction latencies\r\n\r\n--cpu_flags \"{ popcnt }\" # cpuid flags to use when proposing instructions\r\n--mem_read # Propose instructions that read memory\r\n--mem_write # Propose instructions that write memory\r\n\r\n--global_swap_mass 0 # Proposal mass\r\n--instruction_mass 1 # Proposal mass\r\n--local_swap_mass 1 # Proposal mass\r\n--opcode_mass 1 # Proposal mass\r\n--operand_mass 1 # Proposal mass\r\n--resize_mass 0 # Proposal mass\r\n\r\n--nop_percent 80 # Percent of instruction moves that produce nop\r\n--beta 1 # Search annealing constant\r\n--max_instrs 8 # The maximum number of instruction allowed in a rewrite\r\n\r\n--statistics_interval 100000 # Print statistics every 100k proposals\r\n--timeout 1000000 # Propose 1m modifications before giving up\r\n--timeout_action testcase # Try adding a new testcase from the testset when search times out\r\n--timeout_cycles 16 # Timeout up to 16 times before giving up\r\n\r\n--strategy hold_out # Verify results using a larger hold out testcase set\r\n```\r\n\r\nSTOKE search will produce two types of status messages.

Because this is a particularly simple\r\nexample, STOKE is almost guaranteed to produce the optimal rewrite:\r\n\r\n```asm\r\n  .text\r\n  .globl _Z6popcntm\r\n  .type _Z6popcntm @function\r\n_Z6popcntm:\r\n  popcnt %rdi, %rax\r\n  retq\r\n  .size _Z6popcntm, .-_Z6popcntm\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis result can then be patched back into the original binary by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ stoke replace --config replace.conf\r\n    \r\nwhere `result.conf` contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n##### stoke replace config file\r\n\r\n-i ./a.out # Path to the elf binary to patch\r\n--rewrite result.s # Path to the replacement function\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd runtime can once again be measured by typing:\r\n\r\n    $ time ./a.out 100000000\r\n    \r\n    real  0m0.133s\r\n    user  0m0.109s\r\n    sys\t  0m0.000s    \r\n\r\nAs expected, the results are close to an order of magnitude faster than the original.\r\n\r\nUsing the Formal Validator\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis release of STOKE includes a formal validator.  It's design and interface\r\nare detailed in the `src/validator/README.md` file.  To use the formal validator\r\ninstead of hold out testing, specify `--strategy formal` for any\r\nSTOKE binary that you use.\r\n\r\nAn example of using the validator can be found in the `examples/pairity`\r\nfolder; this example has a Makefile much like the tutorial's and should be easy\r\nto follow.  The key difference is that the pairity example does not use\r\ntestcases to guide search.  Instead, after producing a candidate rewrite,\r\nthe validator checks for equivalence.  If the codes are not equivalent, \r\na counterexample is found, and this is used as a new testcase to help guide search.\r\n\r\nThere are some important limitations to keep in mind while using the validator:\r\n\r\n- Only some instructions are supported.  The `--validator_must_support` flag\r\ncan be used to only propose instructions that can be validated.\r\n- Only the general purpose registers, SSE registers (`ymm0`-`ymm15`) and five of\r\nthe status flags (`CF`, `SF`, `PF`, `ZF`, `OF`) are supported.\r\n- There is basic, experimental support for memory.  **Memory is not supported\r\nfor input or output; the validator will check equivalence of codes that use\r\nmemory, but will not check that they leave the machine's memory in the same\r\nstate. **.  For example, if a program writes to memory and then later reads\r\nit, the validator supports this.  But, if two programs manipulate memory,\r\nthe validator will not check if their modifications are equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Features\r\n=====\r\n\r\nIn addition to the subcommands described above, STOKE has facilities for\r\ndebugging and benchmarking the performance of each of its core components:\r\n\r\n- `stoke debug cfg`: Generate a pdf of a control flow graph.\r\n- `stoke debug cost`: Compute the cost of a rewrite.\r\n- `stoke debug sandbox`: Step through the execution of a rewrite.\r\n- `stoke debug search`: View the changes produced by performing and undoing a program transformation.\r\n- `stoke debug state`: Check the behavior of operators that manipulate hardware machine states.\r\n- `stoke debug verify`: Check the equivalence of two programs.\r\n- `stoke benchmark cfg`: Measure the time required to recompute a control flow graph.\r\n- `stoke benchmark cost`: Measure the time required to compute a cost function.\r\n- `stoke benchmark sandbox`: Measure the time required to execute a program in a STOKE sandbox.\r\n- `stoke benchmark search`: Measure the time required to perform and undo a transformation to a program.\r\n- `stoke benchmark state`: Measure the time required to reset the memory of a hardware machine state.\r\n- `stoke benchmark verify`: Measure the time required to check the equivalence of two programs.\r\n\r\nSTOKE also comes with support for bash and zsh completion.  To enable either, type:\r\n\r\n\t$ make bash_completion\r\n\t$ make zsh_completion\r\n\r\nExtending STOKE\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a minimal implementation of STOKE as described in\r\nASPLOS 2013, OOPSLA 2013, and PLDI 2014. Most, but not all of the features\r\ndescribed in those papers appear here. Some of the more experimental features\r\nare not yet ready for public release and have not been provided. Developers who\r\nare interested in refining these features or adding their own extensions are\r\nencouraged to try modifying this implementation as described below.\r\n\r\nCode Organization\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe STOKE source is organized into modules, each of which correspond to a\r\nsubdirectory of the `src/` directory:\r\n\r\n- `src/analysis`: An aliasing analysis used by the validator.\r\n- `src/cfg`: Classes for representing and manipulating control flow graphs.\r\n- `src/cost`: Classes for computing cost functions.\r\n- `src/ext`: External dependencies.\r\n- `src/sandbox`: Classes for safely executing random code sequences.\r\n- `src/search`: Classes for performing MCMC sampling.\r\n- `src/state`: Classes for representing and manipulating hardware machine states.\r\n- `src/symstate`: Classes for modeling the symbolic state of the hardware, used by the formal validator.\r\n- `src/target`: Code to find which instruction sets the CPU supports.\r\n- `src/tunit`: Classes for representing translation units (named instruction sequences).\r\n- `src/verifier`: Wrappers around verification techniques such as testing for formal validation.\r\n- `src/validator`: The formal validator for proving two codes equivalent.\r\n\r\nInitial Search State\r\n-----\r\n\r\nInitial state types are defined in `src/search/init.h` along with an additional\r\ntype for user-defined extensions.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum class Init {\r\n  EMPTY,\r\n  ZERO,\r\n  TARGET,\r\n  PREVIOUS,\r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined extensions here ...\r\n  EXTENSION\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitial state is specified using the `--init` command line argument which controls the initial values\r\ngiven to the current, lowest cost, and lowest cost correct search states. This value\r\naffects the behavior of the `Search::configure() const` method, which\r\ndispatches to the family of `Search::configure_xxxxx() const` methods. User-defined\r\nextensions should be placed in the `Search::configure_extension() const` method,\r\nwhich can be triggered by specifying `--init extension`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid Search::configure_extension(const Cfg& target, SearchState& state) const {\r\n  // Add user-defined logic here ...\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 1: Search state should agree with target on boundary conditions.\r\n  assert(state.current.def_ins() == target.def_ins());\r\n  assert(state.current.live_outs() == target.live_outs());\r\n\r\n  assert(state.best_yet.def_ins() == target.def_ins());\r\n  assert(state.best_yet.live_outs() == target.live_outs());\r\n\r\n  assert(state.best_correct.def_ins() == target.def_ins());\r\n  assert(state.best_correct.live_outs() == target.live_outs());\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 2: Search state must be in a valid state. This function isn't on\r\n  // a critical path, so this can safely be accomplished by calling\r\n  state.current.recompute();\r\n  state.best_yet.recompute();\r\n  state.best_correct.recompute();\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 3: Search state must agree on first instruction. This instruction\r\n  // must be the label definition that appears in the target.\r\n  assert(state.current.get_code()[0] == target.get_code()[0]);\r\n  assert(state.best_yet.get_code()[0] == target.get_code()[0]);\r\n  assert(state.best_correct.get_code()[0] == target.get_code()[0]);\r\n\r\n  // See Search::configure for additional invariants\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSearch Transformations\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTransformation types are defined in `src/search/move.h` along with an\r\nadditional type for user-defined extensions.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum class Move {\r\n  INSTRUCTION = 0,\r\n  OPCODE,\r\n  OPERAND,\r\n  RESIZE,\r\n  LOCAL_SWAP,\r\n  GLOBAL_SWAP,\r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined extensions here ...\r\n  EXTENSION,\r\n\r\n  NUM_MOVES\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTransformations are specified using the family of `--xxxxx_mass` command line\r\narguments. These values control the distribution of proposals that are made by\r\nthe `Transforms::modify()` method and undone by the `Transforms::undo()`\r\nmethod, which dispatch to the family of `Transforms::xxxxx_move()` and\r\n`Transforms::undo_xxxxx_move()` methods respectively. User-defined extensions\r\nshould be placed in the `Transforms::extension_move()` and\r\n`Transforms::undo_extension_move()` methods, which can be triggered by\r\nspecifying a non-zero `--extension_mass`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool Transforms::extension_move(Cfg& cfg) {\r\n  // Add user-defined implementation here ...\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 1:\r\n  // If this method returns true, it should leave this class in a state such\r\n  // that calling undo_extension_move() will revert cfg to its original state.\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 2:\r\n  // If this method returns false, it must leave cfg in its original state.\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 3:\r\n  // If validator_ is non-null, validator_->is_sound(instr) must hold true for\r\n  // all instructions instr upon return.  (You can assume this holds at the\r\n  // beginning).\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 4:\r\n  // Transformations must preserve the first instruction in a code sequence\r\n  // which should be a label that represents the name of a function.\r\n\r\n  return false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nvoid Transforms::undo_extension_move(Cfg& cfg) {\r\n  // Add user-defined implementation here ...\r\n\r\n  // Invariant: If the previous invocation of extension_move() returned true, this\r\n  // method must return cfg to its original state. \r\n  \r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs above, both performing and undoing a transformation should leave a control\r\nflow graph in a valid state. In general, this can be performed by invoking the\r\n`Cfg::recompute()` method. However because these methods are on STOKE's\r\ncritical path, the faster `Cfg::recompute_defs()` method should be used for\r\ntransformations that do not modify control flow structure and only potentially\r\ninvalidate data-flow values.\r\n\r\nPerformance Term\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPerformance term types are defined in `src/cost/performance_term.h` along with an additional type for user-defined extensions.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum class PerformanceTerm {\r\n  NONE,\r\n  SIZE,\r\n  LATENCY,\r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined extensions here ...\r\n  EXTENSION\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance term type is specified using the `--perf` command line argument.\r\nThis value controls the behavior of the `CostFunction::evaluate_performance()\r\n  const` method, which dispatches to the family of\r\n  `CostFunction::xxxxx_performance() const` methods. User-defined extensions\r\n  should be placed in the `CostFunction::extension_performance() const` method,\r\n  which can be triggered by specifying `--perf extension`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nCost CostFunction::extension_performance(const Cfg& cfg) const { \r\n  Cost res = 0;                                                  \r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined implementation here ... \r\n\r\n  // Invariant: Return value should not exceed max_performance_cost \r\n  assert(res <= max_performance_cost); \r\n\r\n  return res;  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrectness Term\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCorrectness term types are defined in `src/cost/reduction.h` along with an additional type for user-defined extensions.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum class Reduction {\r\n  SUM,\r\n  MAX,\r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined extensions here ...\r\n  EXTENSION\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrectness term type is specified using the `--reduction` command line\r\nargument. This value controls the behavior of the\r\n`CostFunction::evaluate_correctness()` method, which dispatches to the family\r\nof `CostFunction::xxxxx_correctness()` methods, each of which represent a\r\nmethod for aggregating errors observed across testcases. User-defined\r\nextensions should be placed in the `CostFunction::extension_correctness()`\r\nmethod, which can be triggered by specifying `--reduction extension`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nCost CostFunction::extension_correctness(const Cfg& cfg, Cost max) {                                             \r\n  Cost res = 0;                                                                                                  \r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined implementation here ... \r\n\r\n  // This method is not required to examine all testcases.

User-defined extensions\r\n  should be placed in the `CostFunction::extension_distance() const` method,\r\n  which can be triggered by specifying `--distance extension`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nCost CostFunction::extension_distance(uint64_t x, uint64_t y) const {                                            \r\n  Cost res = 0;\r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined implementation here ...\r\n\r\n  // Invariant 1: Return value should not exceed max_error_cost\r\n  assert(res <= max_error_cost);\r\n\r\n  return res;                                                                                                   \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVerification Strategy\r\n-----\r\n\r\nVerification strategy types are defined in `src/verifier/strategy.h` along with\r\nan additional type for user-defined extensions.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum class Strategy {\r\n  NONE,\r\n  HOLD_OUT,\r\n  FORMAL,\r\n\r\n  // Add user-defined extensions here ...\r\n  EXTENSION\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nStrategy type is specified using the `--strategy` command line argument.

Argument separators which are printed as part of help\r\nmessages are specified by defining a heading variable:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nauto& heading = Heading::create(\"Heading Description:\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nCommand line flags are specified by declaring a `FlagArg`.\r\n\r\n```c+++\r\nauto& flag = FlagArg::create(\"flag_name\")\r\n  .alternate(\"alternate_flag_name\")\r\n  .description(\"What this flag does\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny of the built-in c++ primitive types are specified by declaring a `ValueArg`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nauto& val = ValueArg<int>::create(\"value_name\")\r\n  .alternate(\"alternate_value_name\")\r\n  .usage(\"<int>\")\r\n  .description(\"What this value represents\")\r\n  .default_val(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUser-defined types are specified by additionally providing function objects that define I/O methods.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nstruct T {\r\n  int x, y, z;\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct Reader {\r\n  void operator()(istream& is, T& t) const {\r\n    is >> t.x >> t.y >> t.z;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct Writer {\r\n  void operator()(ostream& os, const T& t) const {\r\n    os << t.x << \" \" << t.y << \" \" << t.z;\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nauto& val = ValueArg<T, Reader, Writer>::create(\"value_name\")\r\n  .alternate(\"alternate_value_name\")\r\n  .usage(\"<int> <int> <int>\")\r\n  .description(\"What this value represents\")\r\n  .default_val({0,0,0});\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor complex values that are better suited to being read from files, a `FileArg`\r\nmay be more appropriate than a `ValueArg`. The syntax is identical.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nauto& val = FileArg<Complex, ComplexReader, ComplexWriter>::create(\"value_name\")\r\n  .alternate(\"alternate_value_name\")\r\n  .usage(\"<complex representation>\")\r\n  .description(\"What this value represents\")\r\n  .default_val(Complex());\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrequently Asked Questions\r\n=====\r\n\r\nTo appear.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n=====\r\n\r\nQuestions and comments are encouraged.
